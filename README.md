# erpnext_sambapos 
Syncs SambaPOS Sales Invoices to ERPNext. Setup is tedious for now but with enough demand and support we are willing to make it better.

## Requirements
- SambaPOS with SQLExpress or SQL 2014 - 2017
- ERPNext v12

## Prepare localhost environment





Schedule Python Job on Windows
Setup the script
- Install python 3.x for windows - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/
- Install the `pyodbc` driver

	```
	pip install pyodbc
	```
	
- Install git - https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Install Frappe Client in the app root directory (sambapos_erpnext) - https://github.com/the-bantoo/erpnext_sambapos 
	
	```
	git clone https://github.com/the-bantoo/frappe-client.git
	```
	
	```
	pip install -e frappe-client
	```
	
- Setup Windows Scheduler

		Put the directory in the start-in field (without the final backslash), and JUST the filename (and extension) in the program/script field.
		For example if my file is in:
		`C:\Folder1\Folder2\python_file.py`

		Then I'll make a batch file in notepad, run.bat, in the same folder, and just type this inside it:
		python python_file.py

		To run from a very specific version of python with all the correct libraries and not messing with PATH. In this case the batch file would look like this:
		```
		SET PYTHONPATH=C:\localpython\Lib\sitepackages
		C:\localpython\python.exe python_file.py
		```


		Then in the task scheduler I'll set up my regular trigger times and in the action tab, put the info in in the following way:
		Action: start a program
		Program/script: run.bat
		Add arguments (optional): [I leave this blank, I can always put arguments in my batch file]
		Start in (option): C:\Folder1\Folder2

		General > Run whether user is logged on > Tick: Do not store password if password entry fails

## Add ERPNext Custom Fields

### Sales Invoice
- restaurant_name
- restaurant_table
- sambapos_ticket

### Sales Invoice Item

  - Right click table
  - Design
  - Add new column called xUploaded type int
  - Uncheck Allow Nulls
  - Set property Default Value or Binding to 0 (zero digit) 
  - Save and close
  - Repeat for the next tables
  
- ItemUploaded and Order Uploaded to MenuItems, Orders (table)
- TicketUploaded to Tickets
  - Right click table
  - Design
  - Add new column called Modified type datetime
  - Uncheck Allow Nulls
  - Set property Default Value or Binding to (getdate())
  - Save and close

## Edit settings.py

                         dbo.TicketEntities AS te1 ON t.Id = te1.Ticket_Id AND te1.EntityTypeId = 1 LEFT OUTER JOIN
                         dbo.TicketEntities AS te2 ON t.Id = te2.Ticket_Id AND te2.EntityTypeId = 2

```


## Roadmap
- Payment Types
- Deduction of (ingredient) Stock Items
- Make UOM Tree
- Updated sql transactions
	- Batch search: Get list to test against: items (done), groups (done), uoms
	- Update atrributes: Price, UOM, Group -> Update

- Automate the DB Setup in Python SQL
- Create an ERPNext App to hold configs and auto configure erpnext changes
